        <p>
          TinyApp was my first app I developed. Its a full stack web application
          built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã 
          la bit.ly). The project was completed through Node.js, HTML/CSS, and
          Express, with a few additional dependencies as well.
